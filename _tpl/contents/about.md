# About sfftfth

sfftfth is a static site generator written in JavaScript. It transforms Markdown files into static HTML files using
a user-defined theme and a configuration file. It is shipped as a command line utility offering a simple interface
and a good speed.

Posts and pages are written in Markdown and can contain a Frontmatter configuration. It is used by sfftfth to process
them (`static` and `draft` flags as well as `title` and `date`) and is also given to the theme allowing for custom
properties and advanced post handling.

It is an Open Source application hosted at [https://github.com/dak0rn/sfftfth](https://github.com/dak0rn/sfftfth).
